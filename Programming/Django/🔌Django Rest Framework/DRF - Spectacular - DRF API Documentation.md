## 📌 Why API Documentation is Needed

### 1️⃣ **Clarity for API Consumers**

- Explains **how to use** the API: available endpoints, request methods, required parameters, and response formats.
    
- Reduces confusion for developers who integrate with your API.

---

### 2️⃣ **Faster Development & Onboarding**

- New team members can understand the API without having to read all the code.
    
- Third-party developers can integrate without back-and-forth emails.

---

### 3️⃣ **Consistency**

- Standardized docs ensure everyone calls endpoints **the same way** and understands the same rules.
    
- Prevents misuse like wrong HTTP methods or missing authentication headers.
---

### 4️⃣ **Maintainability**

- When your API evolves, docs act as a **reference** to see what’s changed.
    
- Helps in debugging — you can compare actual behavior with documented behavior.
---

### 5️⃣ **Automation & Testing**

- Many tools (Swagger/OpenAPI, Postman) can generate **interactive docs** that also allow testing directly from the documentation page.
